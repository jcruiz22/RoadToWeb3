Project Description
Tutorial on youtube Written tutorial version

This project mints Dynamic NFTs that change based on the market price of an asset pair (for example, the BTC/USD asset price). 
When prices go up, its a bull trend and when the go down its a bear trend. 
We run Chainlink Keepers to have our smart contract automatically called at specified intervals so that on-chain logic checks the Chainlink Price Feed to see if there has been a change in price. 
Accordingly the minted NFTs dynamically alternate between the images below.
